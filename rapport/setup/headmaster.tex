Headmaster is our take on managing the cluster.

It is implemented as a standalone service so that it can be run remotely, and independently from Voldemort.
We later decided to move it closer, so that we could keep better uptime on the service and reduce the chance of conflicts.
At one point we had inadvertently started two Headmasters, which kept fighting for control.
We spent a fair amount of time debugging weird race conditions until we realized there was two services listening.

It is now a master based service with leader election through ZooKeeper that can run on any number of nodes.
