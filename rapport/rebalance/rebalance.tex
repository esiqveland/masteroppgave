\section{Re-balancing}
Re-balancing is the operation of repartitioning the cluster and re-assigning partitions between nodes. A re-partition typically follows a cluster expansion where one or more nodes are added to the cluster, or is a tool used to achieve a more balanced cluster. 

A re-balance is split up into three steps. Preparation, execution and verification.

In the preparation step a plan has to be made. This plan determines which partitions to move in order for the cluster to reach a specified partitioning. In Voldemort this plan is made by first extracting the current cluster and stores meta data from the cluster, and then run the tool RepartitionerCLI.
