\subsection{Extending filesystem}
for more storage, we had to extend the filesystem:

To take advantage of the entire SD card.

\subsection{Setup of Oracle JDK7/8}
For hardfloat and different other things.

JDK7 and especially JDK8 has shown good performance on RPI even compared to native code.

https://jdk8.java.net/download.html

For early access images of JDK8, b123 at time of writing (15.1.2013).

Following the guide at: http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/raspi-jdk8

mkdir -p -v /opt/java

tar xvzf ~/jdk-8-ea-b106-linux-arm-vfp-hflt-04_sep_2013.tar.gz -C /opt/java

To complete the JDK installation we need to let the system know there is a new JVM installed and where it is located.  Use the following command to perform this task.


In the line started with "SRV_JAVA_OPTS" find "-Xmx512m" and change it to a lower value than the physical ram available on your board, 412MB worked well for me.
