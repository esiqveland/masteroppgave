Voldemort is a distributed key-value storage system. 
It is an open source implementation of Amazon's Dynamo storage system. 
It features automatic replication across multiple servers as well as automatic partition of data. 
Similarly to Dynamo it also includes tunable consistency and there is no single point of failure. 

One proposed fun project in the Voldemort system was improving the configuration system by migrating from current XMLs stored locally to an distributed system like Yahoo's ZooKeeper. 
In this project we have set out to explore the configuration requirements of Voldemort and implement and integrate solutions to these with ZooKeeper.
