Voldemort is a distributed key-value storage system. 
It is an open source implementation of Amazon's Dynamo storage system. 
Voldemort features redundancy through automatic replication across multiple servers as well as (assisted) partitioning of data. 
Similarly to Dynamo it also includes tunable consistency.
It's distributed nature also includes no single point of failure, with no members having a special position (no master or coordinator). 

One proposed fun project in the Voldemort system was improving the configuration system by migrating from current XMLs stored locally to a distributed system like Yahoo's ZooKeeper. 
In this project we have set out to explore the configuration requirements of Voldemort and implement and integrate solutions to these with ZooKeeper.
