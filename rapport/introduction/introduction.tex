\section{Introduction}
Voldemort is an implementation of a distributed, highly available key-value store.
The configuration of the system is however cumbersome and tedious, so we would like to explore the possibilities for using ZooKeeper to coordinate configuration and later some management tasks.
Such tasks includes extending and reducing the members of the cluster.

We have created a method for managing cluster metadata and configuration for Voldemort by using Apache ZooKeeper for coordination.

In this process we have implemented an internal StorageEngine that uses ZooKeeper for node configuration and metadata.

We have also implemented a service, named Headmaster, that manages configuration, node discovery and node membership in the cluster.
Headmaster can also decide whether to execute a rebalance based on certain criteria.

\subsection{Voldemort and Dynamo}
Voldemort is a software system based off of Amazon's paper on Dynamo, Amazon's highly available key-value store\cite{dynamo}.

The supported queries are limited to simple get and put operations on objects uniquely identified by a key. 
The objects stored are by the system considered binary blobs.
The database is mainly used to store lots of smaller items, typically less than 1MB in size.

\subsubsection{Motivation for these systems}
Traditional relational database systems are generally very safe to use, usually providing all of the ACID (\emph{Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability}) properties.
This guarantees that all committed transactions are processed reliably.
Experience has however shown that databases providing ACID guarantees have trouble scaling. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to have ACID databases handle the high traffic volumes in addition to the high availability demands of today.

Voldemort and Dynamo sacrifices consistency and isolation requirements to achieve higher availability with satisfactory durability.
In fact, we will later see that most of this behavior is easily tunable and left as design choices per implementation.
You should also note Voldemort (and Dynamo) does not guarantee any form of isolation and does not support multiple key updates.
