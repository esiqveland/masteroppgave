This section will be used to \"prove\" that headmaster will behave correct through unexpected events and user error.

We will cover possible scenarios, write tests to be able to check them and prove that they will not happen.

Possible scenarios:
\begin enumerate
\item Receive events from zookeeper out of order
\item Events lost
\item Config files manually changed in zookeeper
\item 
\end
